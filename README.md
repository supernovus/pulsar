# Rakudo Pulsar

## Introduction

A bleeding edge Rakudo Perl 6 distribution for Docker.

Comes with the 'zef' package manager.

This is not a complete image, and has no CMD or ENTRYPOINT. It's meant as a
base image to build your own standalone Perl 6 applications using Docker.

See the files in examples/ for examples of doing just that.
